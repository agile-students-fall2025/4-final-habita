## 🧩 How Habita Came to Be

The idea for Habita originated during brainstorming sessions about how technology can improve **daily collaboration in shared spaces**.  
Our team noticed that many roommates face frustration over unpaid bills, forgotten chores, and miscommunication.  
We wanted to create an app that combines **organization tools** with **social features** — helping users maintain balance between accountability and friendliness.

Habita was conceptualized as part of the **Agile Software Engineering course at NYU**, where our team applies Scrum principles to plan, design, and implement the app collaboratively over multiple sprints.
